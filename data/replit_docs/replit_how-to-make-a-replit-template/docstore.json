This dependency is already added to the Phaser Vite starter template.\n\nYou can also download the whole project by clicking the three dot menu in the file tree and selecting \"Download as zip\". This method downloads the whole project, including all of the node modules from the project dependencies.\n\nYou can enable or disable Phaser 3 features in the vite.config.js file to optimize your production build. Disable features you don't need to reduce the bundle size.\n\nA note on choosing libraries\u200b\n\nWhen creating a template that uses a specific library, it's a good idea to consider alternative libraries to determine which one will make the best template.\n\nWith the Phaser Vite starter template, for example, we considered the production bundle size when choosing a bundler. We could have made the template with Webpack as a bundler instead of Vite. To compare the bundle sizes of Vite and Webpack, we created production bundles of this Flappy Bird game. We used the Phaser starter template (using Webpack 4) to create the Webpack bundle. The JavaScript bundle size was 1.02 MB using Webpack and 1.29 MB using the Replit Phaser Vite starter template.\n\nTo further reduce bundle size, the configurations of each bundler can be tweaked to optimize the build for a particular project. For example, Storybook compared Webpack and Vite bundling and found that Vite produced smaller production bundles for published Storybooks.\n\nUltimately, we chose Vite to make this Replit Phaser template because of its ease of use and fast development build times, which makes for a better developer experience. Vite also updates the development server when code changes, even before the file is saved. It has very fast Hot Module Replacement.\n\nFurther reading\u200b\n\nHere are some resources to learn more about submitting and configuring templates, configuring Vite, and creating a Phaser 3 game:\n\nSharing Your Repl\n\nReplit's new publish flow\n\nConfiguring a Repl\n\nRepl Space and Templates\n\nHow Replit went from supporting 50 languages to all of them by using Nix\n\nConfiguring Vite\n\nMaking your first Phaser 3 game\n\nReplit hosts Template Jams, template-building competitions with cash prizes for the winning templates.
